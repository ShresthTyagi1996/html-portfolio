  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>Hi, I am Shresth! I am from Delhi, India. I started learning how to develop websites because I have a strong passion for working and wanted to inspire others to start working, too. After many years of drifting from one domain to another, I decided to take matters into my own hands and formed a new philosophy for my life, which is as follows:</p>
  <center><strong><q draggable="true">WHATEVER YOUR HANDS FIND TO DO, DO IT WITH ALL YOUR MIGHT, DO IT WITH ALL YOUR STRENGTH, DO IT WITH ALL YOUR POWER</q></strong></center>
  <p>Since I started learning in July 2023, it has quickly become one of my most enjoyable discipline. I have been in your shoes before, so here at GitHUB I am showcasing my skills to learn something new, be good at it and grow together as a team player.</p>
